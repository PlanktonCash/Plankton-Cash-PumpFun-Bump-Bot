# We are plankton.cash

We offer HTTP endpoints that enable you to programmatically trade on and gather data from the Pump.fun bonding curve.

Our Managed Trading API is designed for simplicity, allowing you to start building within minutes: no libraries to install, and nothing to configure. Simply send an HTTP request, and we take care of the transaction.

For those requiring full security and control over their transactions, our Local Trading API is the perfect choice. Local Trading constructs a transaction that you sign and send yourself using a custom RPC endpoint.

Our Data API is available at no cost (subject to rate limits). Read the next section to start building right away!

Our Trading API boasts the lowest fees at 0.4% per trade.

We are eager to see your trading bots, websites, or any other applications you integrate with our Pump.fun API! Join us on Telegram to ask questions or showcase your projects.&#x20;
